## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create a set of visualizations compiled into a story in Tableau in order to convince investors that a bikesharing-program in Des Moines, Iowa is a solid business proposal. To see how successful this busniess could potentially be, we used NYC Citi Bike data as this is already a business in NYC!

## Results
The general trend that seems to follow in regards to average trip duration by age, is that younger people tend to rely on Citi bikes compared to older people. For the top starting locations, the circles with the darkest color are the most used starting locations. Also, more than half of the users of Citi bikes are subscribers.

Users of Citi Bike usually rent bikes for about 4 - 5 hours typically on the weekdays compared to weekends, with the peak hours being from 5:00 - 7:00 P.M.

In terms of gender, females only rent about 1/4th of the amount of bikes males do. Both genders have the same peak hours for weekly bike usage.

Lastly, when it comes to the two different users of Citi bike, customer and subscriber, subscribers of the company are more likely to actually take trips compared to simply customers, regardless of gender.

## Summary
Overall, Citi Bike NYC seems to be quite a successful business with a number of 2,344,224 rides for the month of August alone. Even though Des Moines is not as populated, Citi Bike would do quite well to generate business as revealed by the results. Most users seem to use the bikes during the weekdays during peak commute hours meaning, these users are most likely using Citi Bike as a resource to commute home rather than sitting in traffic. One major factor from the results revealed that females only engage with Citi Bike about 1/4th of the amount males do. This may be do to the fact that woman feel unsafe riding bikes at certain times of nights or at certain locations. Two visualizations I would suggest for future analysis would be to narrow down on female users to see which starting and stopping locations have the least amount of women users to further improve or even move these locations to areas women would feel more comfortable at.
